Action -> Service -> Reducer -> Renderer -> Action

The Action at first and last are same. This is called Redux pattern.

Steps:
1) Start with a new Application/Module
2) Create the UI (Renderer)
3) Add the Reducer to Observe State changes
4) Add the Service Layer to ingest Actions and return a Result
   Action and ActionProcessors should be 1-to-1 mapping, but can be different Result
   Result<Any> can be Loaded, AfterLoading, Error etc.
5) Emit Actions from the UI Layer, and hook it up.
